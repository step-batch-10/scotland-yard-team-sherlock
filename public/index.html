            <h2 class="heading">The Premise</h2>
            <p>
              Mr. X, a notorious criminal, is on the run through the city.
              Scotland Yard's finest detectives are in pursuit! To evade
              capture, Mr. X must move strategically and conceal his movements.
              The detectives must work together, using their wits and available
              information, to track him down. One player assumes the role of Mr.
              X, while the others play as detectives. The chase unfolds across
              the city, with players utilizing various modes of transportation:
              taxi, bus, and underground.
            </p>

            <h2 class="heading">The Goal</h2>
            <p class="game-objective">
              If you are Mr. X: Your objective is to elude capture for as long
              as possible. You win if the detectives run out of transportation
              tickets.
            </p>
            <p class="game-objective">
              If you are a Detective: Your goal is to apprehend Mr. X by landing
              on the same location he occupies.
            </p>

              </li>
              <li>
                Mr. X's record of moves must be visible to the detectives.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mr. X's Special Abilities</h3>

                <span class="main-point">Surfacing:</span> Mr. X must
                periodically reveal his location to the detectives.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The first reveal is after his 3rd move, and then after moves
                    8, 13, 18, and 24.
                  </li>
                  <li>Mr. X's location is revealed on the game board.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="main-point">Double Moves:</span> Mr. X can use a
                limited number of special moves to travel to two locations in a

                <ul>
                  <li>Both locations and transportation types are recorded.</li>

                the mode of transportation.
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>Black tickets can also be used for boat travel.</li>
                <li>Mr. X can travel along the river using black tickets.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="heading">Game End</h2>
            <p>The game concludes in one of the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A detective lands on Mr. X's location, capturing him. The
                detectives win!
              </li>
              <li>
                The detectives are unable to move due to a lack of fare tickets.
                Mr. X wins!
              </li>
              <li>
                Mr. X successfully makes 24 moves without being captured. Mr. X
                wins!
              </li>
              <li>
                The detectives are unable to move because they lack a particular
                type of ticket needed to move. Mr. X wins!
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="heading">Strategic Tips</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Detectives should start by positioning themselves to maximize
                mobility.
              </li>
              <li>Mr. X should choose surfacing locations carefully.</li>
              <li>
                Mr. X should use black tickets wisely, especially when
                detectives are closing in.
              </li>
              <li>
                Players should pay close attention to the board layout and
                transportation options.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="heading">Advanced Rules</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Mr. X can voluntarily surface at any time, receiving a ticket
                from each detective when he does so.
              </li>
              <li>
                An optional rule prevents Mr. X from moving through a location
                occupied by a detective.
              </li>
